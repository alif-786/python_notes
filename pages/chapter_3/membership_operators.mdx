Certainly! Here's an explanation of membership operators (`in` and `not in`) in Python, along with examples and their outputs:

### Membership Operators in Python

Membership operators are used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence (string, list, tuple, set, or dictionary).

#### 1. `in` Operator

The `in` operator returns `True` if a value exists in the given sequence, otherwise `False`.

**Examples:**

```python copy showLineNumbers
# Example 1: List
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
print('banana' in fruits)  # True

# Example 2: String
print('a' in 'banana')  # True

# Example 3: Tuple
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(3 in numbers)  # True

# Example 4: Set
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
print(4 in my_set)  # False

# Example 5: Dictionary (checks keys, not values)
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}
print('name' in my_dict)  # True
print('John' in my_dict)  # False
```

**Output:**

```
True
True
True
False
True
```

#### 2. `not in` Operator

The `not in` operator returns `True` if a value does not exist in the given sequence, otherwise `False`.

**Examples:**

```python copy showLineNumbers
# Example 1: List
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
print('orange' not in fruits)  # True

# Example 2: String
print('z' not in 'banana')  # True

# Example 3: Tuple
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(5 not in numbers)  # True

# Example 4: Set
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
print(2 not in my_set)  # False

# Example 5: Dictionary (checks keys, not values)
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}
print('height' not in my_dict)  # True
```

**Output:**

```
True
True
True
False
True
```

### Explanation

- **Membership Operators (`in`, `not in`):** They are used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence.
- **Examples:** Demonstrates the use of membership operators with different types of sequences such as lists, strings, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
- **Output:** Shows the result (`True` or `False`) of each membership operation.

These operators are very useful in conditional statements and loops where you need to check if a particular value exists in a sequence before performing certain actions.
