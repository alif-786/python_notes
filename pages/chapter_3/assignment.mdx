# Assignment Operators in Python

Assignment operators in Python are used to assign values to variables. They can also perform operations on variables before assigning the result back to the variable. Here is a list of the assignment operators available in Python along with examples and their outputs.

### 1. Assign (`=`)

The assign operator assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
print(a)  # Output: 5
```

### 2. Add and assign (`+=`)

The add and assign operator adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
a += 3
print(a)  # Output: 8
```

### 3. Subtract and assign (`-=`)

The subtract and assign operator subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
a -= 3
print(a)  # Output: 2
```

### 4. Multiply and assign (`*=`)

The multiply and assign operator multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
a *= 3
print(a)  # Output: 15
```

### 5. Divide and assign (`/=`)

The divide and assign operator divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
a /= 3
print(a)  # Output: 1.6666666666666667
```

### 6. Modulus and assign (`%=`)

The modulus and assign operator takes the modulus using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
a %= 3
print(a)  # Output: 2
```

### 7. Floor divide and assign (`//=`)

The floor divide and assign operator performs floor division on two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
a //= 3
print(a)  # Output: 1
```

### 8. Exponentiate and assign (`**=`)

The exponentiate and assign operator raises the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
a **= 3
print(a)  # Output: 125
```

### 9. Bitwise AND and assign (`&=`)

The bitwise AND and assign operator performs a bitwise AND operation on two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5  # 0b0101
a &= 3 # 0b0011
print(a)  # Output: 1 (0b0001)
```

### 10. Bitwise OR and assign (`|=`)

The bitwise OR and assign operator performs a bitwise OR operation on two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5  # 0b0101
a |= 3 # 0b0011
print(a)  # Output: 7 (0b0111)
```

### 11. Bitwise XOR and assign (`^=`)

The bitwise XOR and assign operator performs a bitwise XOR operation on two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5  # 0b0101
a ^= 3 # 0b0011
print(a)  # Output: 6 (0b0110)
```

### 12. Right shift and assign (`>>=`)

The right shift and assign operator performs a right shift operation on the left operand by the number of positions specified by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5  # 0b0101
a >>= 1
print(a)  # Output: 2 (0b0010)
```

### 13. Left shift and assign (`<<=`)

The left shift and assign operator performs a left shift operation on the left operand by the number of positions specified by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5  # 0b0101
a <<= 1
print(a)  # Output: 10 (0b1010)
```

Assignment operators are used extensively in Python to manage the values of variables efficiently while performing operations simultaneously.
