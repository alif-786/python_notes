# Introduction to Operators in Python

Operators are special symbols in Python that are used to perform operations on variables and values. Python supports a variety of operators, each serving different purposes and providing unique functionalities. These operators can be categorized into several types:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**
2. **Comparison (Relational) Operators**
3. **Assignment Operators**
4. **Logical Operators**
5. **Bitwise Operators**
6. **Membership Operators**
7. **Identity Operators**

### 1. Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

| Operator | Description          | Example       |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| `+`      | Addition             | `a + b`       |
| `-`      | Subtraction          | `a - b`       |
| `*`      | Multiplication       | `a * b`       |
| `/`      | Division             | `a / b`       |
| `%`      | Modulus              | `a % b`       |
| `**`     | Exponentiation       | `a ** b`      |
| `//`     | Floor Division       | `a // b`      |

### 2. Comparison (Relational) Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They return either `True` or `False` based on the comparison.

| Operator | Description          | Example       |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| `==`     | Equal to             | `a == b`      |
| `!=`     | Not equal to         | `a != b`      |
| `>`      | Greater than         | `a > b`       |
| `<`      | Less than            | `a < b`       |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `a >= b` |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    | `a <= b` |

### 3. Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

| Operator | Description          | Example       |
|----------|----------------------|---------------|
| `=`      | Assign               | `a = b`       |
| `+=`     | Add and assign       | `a += b`      |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign  | `a -= b`      |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign  | `a *= b`      |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign    | `a /= b`      |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign   | `a %= b`      |
| `//=`    | Floor divide and assign | `a //= b` |
| `**=`    | Exponentiate and assign | `a **= b` |
| `&=`     | Bitwise AND and assign | `a &= b`   |
| `|=`     | Bitwise OR
