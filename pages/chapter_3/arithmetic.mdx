# Arithmetic Operators in Python

Arithmetic operators in Python are used to perform common mathematical operations on numeric values. Here is a list of the arithmetic operators available in Python along with examples and their outputs.

### 1. Addition (`+`)

The addition operator adds two numbers.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
b = 3
result = a + b
print(result)  
```
Output: 
```
8
```

### 2. Subtraction (`-`)

The subtraction operator subtracts one number from another.

```python
a = 5
b = 3
result = a - b
print(result)  
```
Output:
```
 2
```

### 3. Multiplication (`*`)

The multiplication operator multiplies two numbers.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
b = 3
result = a * b
print(result) 
```
 Output:
 ```
15
```

### 4. Division (`/`)

The division operator divides one number by another and returns a float result.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
b = 3
result = a / b
print(result)  
```
Output:
```
 1.6666666666666667
```

### 5. Modulus (`%`)

The modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of one number by another.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
b = 3
result = a % b
print(result)  
```
Output:
```
2
```

### 6. Exponentiation (`**`)

The exponentiation operator raises one number to the power of another.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
b = 3
result = a ** b
print(result) 
```
Output:
```
 125
```

### 7. Floor Division (`//`)

The floor division operator divides one number by another and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
b = 3
result = a // b
print(result)  
```
Output:
```
 1
```
