# Python Arithmetic Operators

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)
# WE HAVE USED + OPERATOR ON VARIABLE
```
Output:
```
8
```
---

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 5
y = 3
print(x - y)
```
Output:
```
2
```
---

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 5
y = 3
print(x * y)
```
Output:
```
15
```
---

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 5
y = 3
print(x / y)
# Division will give correct output till 15th digit
```
Output:
```
1.6666666666666667
```
---

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 25
y = 7
print(x % y) # 25%7
# we will get the remainder value
# 25/7 => 3.5
# quotient => 3
# remainder => 4
```
Output:
```
4
```
---

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 25
y = 3
print(x // y)
print(x % y)
# floor => Lowest Nearest Real Value
# the floor division // rounds the result down to the nearest whole number
```
Output:
```
8
1
```
---

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 2
y = 3
print(x ** y) # same as 2*2*2
# 2**5 => Exponent (to the power of)
```
Output:
```
8

print(x)
```
Output:
```
5
```
---

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 5
x += 3
# x = x + 3
# x = 5 + 3
print(x)
# Python program will run in Top -> Bottom direction &
# execute in the direction of Right to Left
```
Output:
```
8
```
---

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 5
x -= 3
# x = x-3
# x = 5-3
print(x)
```
Output:
```

```
---

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 5
x *= 3
print(x)

```
---

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 5
x %= 3
# x = x%3
# x = 5%3
print(x)
```
Output:
```
2
```
---

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 5
x //= 3
print(x)
# x = 5//3 Floor => Quotient
```
Output:
```
1
```
---

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 2
x **= 4
# x = x**4
# x = 2*2*2*2
print(x)
```
Output:
```
16

# Comparison Operators

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 6
y = 7

print(x == y)
# returns False

print(x != y)
# returns True

print(x > y)
# returns False

print(x < y)
# returns True

print(x >= y)
# returns False

print(x <= y)
# returns True

# Python Logical Operators

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 5
print(x > 3 and x > 10)
# False
```
---

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 5
print(x < 7 or x < 4)
# True
```
---

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 5
print(not(x < 3 and x < 10))
# True
# returns True because not is used to reverse the result
```
---

```python
age = 700
if age >= 18 and age <= 100:
    print("You can vote")
else:
    print("You need to wait")

# Membership Operator

```raw
in -> it checks if any substring is present in the main string or not, if yes - True
not in -> it checks if any substring is present in the main string or not, if no - True
```

```python
alpha = 'abcde'
print('a' in alpha)
# True
print('p' in alpha)
# False
```
---

print('a' not in alpha)
# False
```

```python
a, b, c = 10, 10, 5
print(a is b)
# True
print(a is c)
# False
```
---

print(a is not b)
# False
print(a is not c)
# True
```
