# Comparison Operators in Python

Comparison operators in Python are used to compare two values. They return either `True` or `False` based on the comparison. Here is a list of the comparison operators available in Python along with examples and their outputs.

### 1. Equal to (`==`)

The equal to operator checks if two values are equal.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
b = 3
result = (a == b)
print(result)  # Output: False
```

### 2. Not equal to (`!=`)

The not equal to operator checks if two values are not equal.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
b = 3
result = (a != b)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

### 3. Greater than (`>`)

The greater than operator checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
b = 3
result = (a > b)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

### 4. Less than (`<`)

The less than operator checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
b = 3
result = (a < b)
print(result)  # Output: False
```

### 5. Greater than or equal to (`>=`)

The greater than or equal to operator checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
b = 3
result = (a >= b)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

### 6. Less than or equal to (`<=`)

The less than or equal to operator checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

```python copy showLineNumbers copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
b = 3
result = (a <= b)
print(result)  
```
 Output: 
```
 False
```

Comparison operators are essential in making decisions within your code, allowing you to execute different code blocks based on specific conditions.
