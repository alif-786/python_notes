# Keywords in Python

Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names or function names). They form the basic syntax of the language and are used to define the structure and logic of Python programs.

## List of Keywords

Python has a set of keywords that are reserved and have specific meanings. Here are some of the common keywords:

```plaintext
False      class      finally    is         return
None       continue   for        lambda     try
True       def        from       nonlocal   while
and        del        global     not        with
as         elif       if         or         yield
assert     else       import     pass
break      except     in         raise
```

## Examples and Outputs

### Example 1: `if`, `else`

The `if` and `else` keywords are used for conditional execution.

```python copy showLineNumbers
# Example using if-else
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")
```

**Output**:
```
x is greater than 5
```

### Example 2: `for`, `in`

The `for` and `in` keywords are used for looping over sequences.

```python copy showLineNumbers
# Example using for-in
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

**Output**:
```
apple
banana
cherry
```

### Example 3: `while`, `break`

The `while` and `break` keywords are used for creating loops and breaking out of them.

```python copy showLineNumbers
# Example using while-break
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
    if count == 3:
        break
```

**Output**:
```
0
1
2
```

### Example 4: `def`, `return`

The `def` and `return` keywords are used for defining functions and returning values from them.

```python copy showLineNumbers
# Example using def-return
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print("Result:", result)
```

**Output**:
```
Result: 8
```

## Basic Information

- Keywords are reserved words and cannot be used as variable names or function names.
- They form the basic syntax of Python and define the structure and logic of Python programs.
- Using keywords incorrectly (e.g., as variable names) will result in a syntax error.

## Conclusion

Understanding keywords is essential for writing Python programs. They define the syntax and structure of your code and provide the basic building blocks for programming in Python. By using keywords correctly, you can write clear, readable, and efficient code.
