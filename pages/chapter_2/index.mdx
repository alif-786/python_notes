# Variables in Python

Variables are used to store information that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. Python handles variable declaration and assignment dynamically, making it straightforward to use.

## Declaring Variables

In Python, you declare a variable by simply assigning a value to it using the `=` operator.

```python copy showLineNumbers
# Variable declarations
x = 10
name = "Alice"
is_active = True

```

In the examples above:

* x is an integer variable.
* name is a string variable.
* is_active is a boolean variable.


## Rules for Variable Names
* Must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
* Cannot start with a number.
* Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
* Case-sensitive: variable and Variable are different.
* Cannot use Python reserved keywords (like if, else, while, for, etc.).
