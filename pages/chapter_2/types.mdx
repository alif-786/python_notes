# Types of Variable Declarations in Python

In Python, variables can hold different types of data. Here, we'll cover the main types of variable declarations, including examples, explanations, and their outputs.

## 1. Integer

An integer is a whole number without a fractional part.

``` python copy showLineNumbers
# Integer variable
age = 25
print("Age:", age)
```

**Output**:
```
Age: 25
```

**Explanation**: The variable `age` is assigned the integer value `25`.

## 2. Float

A float is a number with a decimal point or in exponential form.

``` python copy showLineNumbers
# Float variable
height = 5.9
print("Height:", height)
```

**Output**:
```
Height: 5.9
```

**Explanation**: The variable `height` is assigned the float value `5.9`.

## 3. String

A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes (' ') or double quotes (" ").

``` python copy showLineNumbers
# String variable
name = "Alice"
print("Name:", name)
```

**Output**:
```
Name: Alice
```

**Explanation**: The variable `name` is assigned the string value `"Alice"`.

## 4. Boolean

A boolean variable can hold one of two values: `True` or `False`.

``` python copy showLineNumbers
# Boolean variable
is_active = True
print("Is Active:", is_active)
```

**Output**:
```
Is Active: True
```

**Explanation**: The variable `is_active` is assigned the boolean value `True`.

## 5. List

A list is an ordered collection of items, which can be of different types.

``` python copy showLineNumbers
# List variable
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("Fruits:", fruits)
```

**Output**:
```
Fruits: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

**Explanation**: The variable `fruits` is assigned a list containing three string elements.

## 6. Tuple

A tuple is similar to a list but is immutable (cannot be changed after creation).

``` python copy showLineNumbers
# Tuple variable
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
print("Coordinates:", coordinates)
```

**Output**:
```
Coordinates: (10.0, 20.0)
```

**Explanation**: The variable `coordinates` is assigned a tuple containing two float elements.

## 7. Dictionary

A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.

``` python copy showLineNumbers
# Dictionary variable
person = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "is_employee": True
}
print("Person:", person)
```

**Output**:
```
Person: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'is_employee': True}
```

**Explanation**: The variable `person` is assigned a dictionary with keys `"name"`, `"age"`, and `"is_employee"`.

## 8. Set

A set is an unordered collection of unique items.

``` python copy showLineNumbers
# Set variable
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print("Unique Numbers:", unique_numbers)
```

**Output**:
```
Unique Numbers: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

**Explanation**: The variable `unique_numbers` is assigned a set containing five unique integers.

## Conclusion

Python provides a variety of ways to declare variables, each suited for different types of data. Understanding these types and how to use them is fundamental to effective programming in Python. By leveraging the appropriate variable type, you can write clearer and more efficient code.
