# The `id()` Function in Python

The `id()` function in Python returns the identity (unique identifier) of an object. This identifier is a unique integer for the object during its lifetime. The `id()` function can be used to verify whether two variables reference the same object.

## Syntax

```python copy showLineNumbers
id(object)
```

- **object**: The object whose identity you want to determine.

The `id()` function returns the identity of the specified object.

## Example: Using `id()`

Let's look at an example to see how the `id()` function works:

```python copy showLineNumbers
# Example variables
a = 10
b = a
c = 10

# Using id() to check identities
print("Identity of a:", id(a))
print("Identity of b:", id(b))
print("Identity of c:", id(c))
```

**Output**:
```
Identity of a: 140732686161232
Identity of b: 140732686161232
Identity of c: 140732686161232
```

**Explanation**: 
- `a` and `c` have the same value (`10`), so they share the same identity.
- `b` is assigned the same value as `a`, so it shares the same identity as well.

## Basic Information

- The `id()` function is useful for checking if two variables reference the same object.
- It returns a unique integer that represents the identity of the object.

## Conclusion

The `id()` function in Python provides a unique identifier for an object, allowing you to verify if two variables are referencing the same object. Understanding object identity is crucial for managing data and ensuring correct program behavior.
