# The `ceil()` Function in Python

The `ceil()` function in Python is part of the `math` module. It returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number. This is useful for rounding up numbers to the nearest whole number.

To use the `ceil()` function, you must first import the `math` module.

### Syntax

```python copy showLineNumbers
import math
result = math.ceil(x)
```

- `x` : The number to be rounded up.

### Example

Here is an example demonstrating the use of the `ceil()` function:

```python copy showLineNumbers
import math

# Example 1
number = 4.2
result = math.ceil(number)
print(result)  # Output: 5

# Example 2
number = -3.7
result = math.ceil(number)
print(result)  # Output: -3

# Example 3
number = 7.0
result = math.ceil(number)
print(result)  # Output: 7
```

### Output

```python copy showLineNumbers
5
-3
7
```

In the first example, `4.2` is rounded up to `5`. In the second example, `-3.7` is rounded up to `-3` (closer to zero). In the third example, `7.0` remains `7` because it is already an integer.

The `ceil()` function is useful when you need to ensure that a number is rounded up to the nearest integer, regardless of its decimal value.
