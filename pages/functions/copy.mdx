# The `copy()` Function in Python

The `copy()` function in Python is used to create a shallow copy of an object. It returns a new object that is a copy of the original object, but with a separate identity.

## Syntax

```python copy showLineNumbers
copy.copy(object)
```

- **object**: The object that you want to copy.

The `copy()` function returns a shallow copy of the specified object.

## Example: Using `copy()`

Let's look at an example to see how the `copy()` function works:

```python copy showLineNumbers
import copy

# Example list
original_list = [1, 2, 3]

# Creating a copy using copy()
copied_list = copy.copy(original_list)

# Modifying the copied list
copied_list.append(4)

# Print both lists
print("Original List:", original_list)
print("Copied List:", copied_list)
```

**Output**:
```
Original List: [1, 2, 3]
Copied List: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Explanation**: 
- We import the `copy` module.
- `original_list` is a list with elements `[1, 2, 3]`.
- We create a copy of `original_list` using `copy.copy(original_list)`.
- We append `4` to `copied_list`.
- The modification in `copied_list` does not affect `original_list`, demonstrating that `copy()` creates a shallow copy.

## Basic Information

- The `copy()` function is used to create a shallow copy of an object.
- Shallow copy means that the outermost container is duplicated, but the inner objects are referenced.
- It is useful for creating independent copies of mutable objects like lists and dictionaries.

## Conclusion

The `copy()` function in Python is handy for creating shallow copies of objects. Understanding the difference between shallow and deep copies is crucial for managing data and avoiding unintended side effects in your programs.
