# The `type()` Function in Python

The `type()` function in Python is used to determine the type of an object. This can be particularly useful for debugging and ensuring that variables are of the expected type.

## Syntax

```python
type(object)
```

* object: The object whose type you want to determine.
The `type()` function returns the type of the specified object.

## Example: Using `type()`
Let's look at an example to see how the` type() `function works:

# Example variables
integer_variable = 10
string_variable = "Hello, World!"
list_variable = [1, 2, 3]

```python copy showLineNumbers
# Using type() to check the types
print("Type of integer_variable:", type(integer_variable))
print("Type of string_variable:", type(string_variable))
print("Type of list_variable:", type(list_variable))
```

In this example:

* We define three variables: an integer, a string, and a list.
* We use the type() function to print the types of these variables.
When you run this code, you will see the following output:
```
Type of integer_variable: <class 'int'>
Type of string_variable: <class 'str'>
Type of list_variable: <class 'list'>

```
This output shows that integer_variable is of type int, string_variable is of type str, and list_variable is of type list.
