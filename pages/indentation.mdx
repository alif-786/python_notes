# Indentation in Python

Indentation is a fundamental aspect of Python's syntax. Unlike many other programming languages that use braces or other symbols to define code blocks, Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. This makes Python code visually clean and easy to read.

## Importance of Indentation

In Python, indentation is not just for readability; it is a requirement. Incorrect indentation will lead to errors.

## Syntax

Python uses a colon (:) to start a new block of code, and the following lines must be indented. Typically, four spaces are used for indentation.

## Examples

### Example 1: If Statement

```python copy showLineNumbers
# Correct indentation
if True:
    print("This is indented correctly.")

# Incorrect indentation
if True:
print("This will cause an IndentationError.")
```
---
## Example 2 : for loop

```python copy showLineNumbers
# Correct indentation
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Incorrect indentation
for i in range(5):
print(i)

```
In the first block, the print statement is indented, making it part of the for loop. In the second block, the print statement is not indented, leading to an error.
