# The `all()` Function in Python

The `all()` function in Python is a built-in function that returns `True` if all elements of an iterable (such as a list, tuple, set, etc.) are true. If the iterable is empty, it returns `True` (since there are no elements to evaluate).

## Syntax

```python copy showLineNumbers
all(iterable)
```

- `iterable`: An iterable object (like a list, tuple, set, etc.) that contains the elements to check.

## Usage

The `all()` function iterates over all elements of the iterable and returns `True` if all elements are truthy. If any element is falsy (or if the iterable is empty), it returns `False`.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Using `all()` with a List

```python copy showLineNumbers
# Example 1: Using all() with a List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Check if all numbers in the list are greater than 0
result = all(num > 0 for num in numbers)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
True
```

Explanation:
- In this example, the `all()` function checks if all numbers in the `numbers` list are greater than 0.
- Since all numbers in the list satisfy the condition (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are all greater than 0), the `all()` function returns `True`.

#### Example 2: Using `all()` with a List Containing Falsy Values

```python copy showLineNumbers
# Example 2: Using all() with a List Containing Falsy Values
values = [True, True, False, True]

# Check if all values in the list are True
result = all(values)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
False
```

Explanation:
- In this example, the `all()` function checks if all values in the `values` list are true.
- The list contains `True`, `True`, `False`, `True`. Since not all values are `True`, the `all()` function returns `False`.

### Notes

- The `all()` function short-circuits; it stops as soon as it finds a falsy value, so it can be more efficient than manually checking each element.
- It is particularly useful in conjunction with conditional expressions and comprehensions.

The `all()` function is a useful tool for quickly checking the truthiness of all elements in an iterable in Python.
