### Predefined Values in Python

Predefined values in Python are built-in constants and types that come with the language. These values are always available and provide fundamental functionality.

#### Boolean Values: `True`, `False`

Boolean values represent truth values and are commonly used in conditional statements and expressions.

**Example:**

```python copy showLineNumbers
print(True)   # Output: True
print(False)  # Output: False
```

#### None

`None` represents the absence of a value or a null value. It is often used to signify 'nothing' or 'no value here'.

**Example:**

```python copy showLineNumbers
print(None)   # Output: None
```

#### Numeric Types: `int`, `float`

Numeric types include integers (`int`) and floating-point numbers (`float`). These are used for mathematical calculations and representing numeric data.

**Example:**

```python copy showLineNumbers
print(42)     # Output: 42
print(3.14)   # Output: 3.14
```

#### Sequences: `str`, `list`

Sequences include strings (`str`) and lists (`list`). Strings are used for text data, while lists are used to store collections of items.

**Example:**

```python copy showLineNumbers
print("hello")        # Output: hello
print([1, 2, 3])      # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

### Summary

- **Boolean Values**: `True`, `False` - Represent truth values.
- **None**: Represents the absence of a value.
- **Numeric Types**: `int`, `float` - Represent integers and floating-point numbers.
- **Sequences**: `str`, `list` - Represent text data and collections of items.

### user-defined Values in Python
It means we are asking to enter any type of value to the user at a runtaime. These values are not pre-defined for this purpose we need to use one function called as input()


### `input()` Function in Python

The `input()` function in Python allows you to accept user input. It reads a line from input, converts it into a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that. This function is primarily used in console-based programs where the user enters text or numeric data.

#### Example

```python copy showLineNumbers
# Prompting the user for their name
name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Prompting the user for their age
age = input("Enter your age: ")

# Displaying the entered values
print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
```

#### Output

```mdx
Enter your name: John
Enter your age: 30
Hello, John! You are 30 years old.
```

### Explanation

1. **Prompting for Input**: The `input()` function takes a prompt (a string) as an argument. This prompt is displayed to the user before input is taken.

2. **User Input**: The user enters their response in the console. Here, "John" and "30" are entered as the name and age respectively.

3. **String Conversion**: The input from `input()` is returned as a string. If you need to work with a different type (like an integer or float), you'll need to convert it explicitly using `int()` or `float()`.

4. **Output**: The program then uses `print()` to display a message that includes the user's entered name and age.

### Notes

- **String Input**: The `input()` function always returns a string, so you may need to convert it to a numeric type (like `int` or `float`) if you want to perform calculations.
- **User Interaction**: `input()` allows for interactive use of your program, making it more dynamic and responsive.

This example demonstrates the basic usage of `input()` to get user input and how to incorporate that input into a message for output.
