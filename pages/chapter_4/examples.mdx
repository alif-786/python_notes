Certainly! Here's the conversion of your Python code examples into MDX format with explanations, examples, and outputs formatted for clarity:

### Decision Making (`if...else` Statement)

#### Example 1: Single Statement Suite

```python copy showLineNumbers
var = 11001

if (var == 1001): #1001==100
    print("Automatically take indentation")
    print("Value of expression is 100")
    
print("Good bye!")
```

#### Output:

```
Good bye!
```

---

#### Example 2: Simple `if...else` Statement

```python copy showLineNumbers
x = 40

if (x < 12):
    print("40 is greater than 12")
else:
    print("40 is less than 12")
```

#### Output:

```
40 is less than 12
```

---

#### Example 3: `if` Statement Without Else

```python copy showLineNumbers
var = 100

if (var == 1010):
    print("Value of expression is 100")

print("Good bye!")
```

#### Output:

```
Good bye!
```

#### Example 4: Conditional Voting Eligibility Check

```python copy showLineNumbers
try:
    age = float(input("Enter your age "))
    if (age >= 18 and age <= 100):
        print("You can Vote")
    else:
        print("You need to wait for voting")
    print(type(age))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid age entered. Please enter a valid age.")
```

#### Output:

```
Enter your age Ronald
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'Ronald'
```

---

#### Example 5: Basic Input and Output

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = input("Enter your age ")
print(a)
print(type(a))
```

#### Output:

```
Enter your age 40
40
<class 'str'>
```

---

#### Example 6: Checking Even or Odd Number

```python copy showLineNumbers
num = int(input("Enter the number? "))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Number is Even")
else:
    print("Number is Odd")
```

#### Output:

```
Enter the number? 5
Number is Odd
```

---

#### Example 7: Finding the Largest of Three Numbers

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = int(input("Enter a? "))
b = int(input("Enter b? "))
c = int(input("Enter c? "))

if a > b and a > c:
    print("a is largest")
if b > a and b > c:
    print("b is largest")
if c > a and c > b:
    print("c is largest")
```

#### Output:

```
Enter a? 4
Enter b? 4
Enter c? 5
c is largest
```

---

#### Example 8: Finding the Smallest of Three Numbers

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = int(input("Enter a? "))
b = int(input("Enter b? "))
c = int(input("Enter c? "))

if a < b and a < c:
    print("a is lowest")
if b < a and b < c:
    print("b is lowest")
if c < a and c < b:
    print("c is lowest")
```

#### Output:

```
Enter a? 10
Enter b? 18
Enter c? 16
a is lowest
```

---

#### Example 9: Boolean Values in `if...else`

```python copy showLineNumbers
var1 = -10
if var1:
    print("1 - Got a true expression value")
    print(var1)
else:
    print("1 - Got a false expression value")
    print(var1)

var2 = 0
if var2:
    print("2 - Got a true expression value")
    print(var2)
else:
    print("False")
    print(var2)

print("Good bye!")
```

#### Output:

```
1 - Got a true expression value
-10
False
0
Good bye!
```

---

#### Example 10: Nested `if` Statements

```python copy showLineNumbers
var = 157
if var < 400:
    print("Expression value is less than 200")
    if var <= 150:
        print ("Which is 150")
    elif var == 100:
        print ("Which is 100")
    elif var == 50:
        print ("Which is 50")
    elif var < 50:
        print("Expression value is less than 50")
    else:
        print("Nothing")
else:
    print("Could not find true expression")

print("Good bye!")
```

#### Output:

```
Expression value is less than 200
Which is 150
Good bye!
```

---

#### Example 11: Grading based on Percentage

```python copy showLineNumbers
marks = float(input("Enter the Percentage? "))

if marks > 85 and marks <= 100:
    print("Congrats! You have scored grade A ...")
elif marks > 60 and marks <= 85:
    print("You have scored grade B + ...")
elif marks > 40 and marks <= 60:
    print("You have scored grade B ...")
elif marks > 30 and marks <= 40:
    print("You have scored grade C ...")
elif marks > 100:
    print("Invalid")
else:
    print("Sorry, you have failed..")
```

#### Output:

```
Enter the Percentage? 78
You have scored grade B + ...
```

### Ternary Operator

#### Explanation

The ternary operator is a shorthand for an if-else statement. The syntax is `value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`. It's a one-liner that can replace a multi-line `if-else` statement, making your code more concise.

#### Example 12: Using Ternary Operator

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 50
b = 10
max = a if a > b else b
print(max)
```

#### Output:

```
50
```

---

#### Example 13: Nested Ternary Operator

```python copy showLineNumbers
a, b = 10, 20
print("Both a and b are equal" if a == b else "a is greater than b" if a > b else "b is greater than a")
```

#### Output:

```
b is greater than a
```

---

#### Example 14: Using Nested `if` Statements (Equivalent to Example 13)

```python copy showLineNumbers
a, b = 10, 20
if a == b:
    print("Both a and b are equal")
else:
    if a > b:
        print("a is greater than b")
    else:
        print("b is greater than a")
```

#### Output:

```
b is greater than a
```

---

#### Example 15: Using Nested `if...else` Statements

```python copy showLineNumbers
a, b = 10, 20

if a != b:
    if a > b:
        print("a is greater than b")
    else:
        print("b is greater than a")
else:
    print("Both a and b are equal")
```

#### Output:

```
b is greater than a
```

---

#### Example 16: Conditional Expression using Ternary Operator

```python copy showLineNumbers
a = 5
b = 7

result = (str(a) + " is greater") if (a > b) else (str(b) + " is Greater")
print(result)
```

#### Output:

```
7 is Greater
```

---

#### Example 17: Shortest Value in Ternary Operator

```python copy showLineNumbers
a, b = 2, 20
min = a < b and a or b
print(min)
```

#### Output:

```
2
```

---

#### Example 18: Largest Value in Ternary Operator

```python copy showLineNumbers
a, b = 2, 20
max = a > b and a or b
print(max)
```

#### Output:

```
20
```
