Unlike many other programming languages that use braces or other symbols to define code blocks, Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. This makes Python code visually clean and easy to read.","importance-of-indentation#Importance of Indentation":"In Python, indentation is not just for readability; it is a requirement. Incorrect indentation will lead to errors.","syntax#Syntax":"Python uses a colon (:) to start a new block of code, and the following lines must be indented. Typically, four spaces are used for indentation.","examples#Examples":"","example-1-if-statement#Example 1: If Statement":"# Correct indentation\r\nif True:\r\n    print(\"This is indented correctly.\")\r\n\r\n# Incorrect indentation\r\nif True:\r\nprint(\"This will cause an IndentationError.\")","example-2--for-loop#Example 2 : for loop":"# Correct indentation\r\nfor i in range(5):\r\n    print(i)\r\n\r\n# Incorrect indentation\r\nfor i in range(5):\r\nprint(i)\r\nIn the first block, the print statement is indented, making it part of the for loop. In the second block, the print statement is not indented, leading to an error."}}}
